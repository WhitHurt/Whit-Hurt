<h3>Hi, my name is Whit Hurt. I am a 16 year old boy who wants to take up a career in agriculture. I attend Trinity Christian Academy, where I make solid grades and ended up with a 3.6 GPA at the end of my freshman year, and a 3.4 at the end of my sophomore year. I am currently a junior in highschool, but I plan to attend Texas AM or Mississippi State for college. I have previously worked at Hurt Seed Company, were I have had a variety of jobs, however the majority of my work has been in the farming branch of the company.
